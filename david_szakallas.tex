\section{Interests}

I consider myself a polyglot living by the phrase
``choose the best tool for the job''. I started to dive into \textbf{functional programming} early in my career.
Now, I have a track record of working with Scala, JavaScript, Python and Java. I also programmed at
some point in Clojure, \cpp{}, R, Rust and Go. I have experience with \textbf{distributed data processing},
most notably Apache Spark. I know about relational algebra and declarative query languages
such as SQL, Cypher and SPARQL. I am also interested in \textbf{blockchain} technologies
and other distributed trustless applications.

\begin{twenty} % Environment for a list with descriptions
	\twentyitem{Oct 2017 - }{Data Engineer}{RisingStack (Budapest)}{Our team at the Budapest office of Whitepages develops an ETL pipeline driving the person search which is trusted by millions of users every month.

My responsibilities include developing the Spark application in Scala, as well as preparing, ingesting, analysing and releasing data.}
	\twentyitem{May 2017 - Oct 2017}{M.Sc. Student}{Budapest University of Technology and Economics}{I am developing a local-search based pattern-matching engine for ingraph, an open-source incremental graph query engine for openCypher developed in the Lend√ºlet Project. My contribution - written in Clojure - forms the basis of my Master's Thesis.}
	\twentyitem{Jan 2016 - May 2017}{Software Developer}{RisingStack (Budapest)}{My responsibilities include developing, supporting and releasing the monitoring agent written in Node.js. Furthermore, I am part of the team developing the back end microservices of the distributed tracing feature, gaining experience in industry-standard distributed tracing technologies such as OpenZipkin, OpenTracing and Google Dapper. Developing our microservice architecture gave me experience in Kubernetes and RabbitMQ.}
  
	\twentyitem{Nov 2014 - Aug 2015}{Technology Intern}{Morgan Stanley (Budapest)}{
I was part of the Interest Rates Derivatives team in Budapest. I worked part-time developing an application for analysing logs of an internal messaging system for my Project Laboratory assignment using the ELK stack, Scala and relational DBs. During the summer I worked full-time in a team of three, developing a financial application based on an internal distributed application platform written in Scala.}

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
